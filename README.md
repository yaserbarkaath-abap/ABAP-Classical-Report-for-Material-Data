# ABAP-Classical-Report-for-Material-Data
Developed a dynamic ABAP Classical Report to fetch material master data from the MARA table. Implemented selection options, parameters, and checkbox-driven screen logic. Added date validations, structured output with headers and pagination using event blocks.
